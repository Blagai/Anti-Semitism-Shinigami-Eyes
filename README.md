# Known issues:
* Marking a facebook group marks the user of everyone inside it the same colour if seen through a post on the group page — low priority.
* User marking in TikTok is impossible because they have their own stupid UI — will not bother fixing.
* The time since upload is what's coloured in TikTok, and not the username - low priority.
* FireFox version doesn't work on Google.com and has a weird bug when marking anything it adds random sites to the array - high priority.
* Youtube sometimes colours incorrect channels — high priority.
