# Anti-Semitism Shinigami Eyes
 
An extension that highlights Anti-Semitic and Jewish-friendly subreddits/users/facebook pages/groups with different colors.

Not all supported sites work yet, and there is no data. Data gathering will only start once I finish all the base functionalities.

Server version is incomplete and doesn't work unless I manually set the server to be online every few minutes. It works locally just the same as the regular version, so if you really want to use it you can.

# List of supported sites:
* Google ✅
* DuckDuckGo ✅
* Bing ✅
* Wikipedia ✅
* YouTube ✅
* Reddit ✅
* Tumblr ✅
* Twitter ✅
* Medium (not developed yet)
* Facebook (bugged)
* Tiktok (partial)

# Known issues:
* Marking a facebook group marks the user of everyone inside it the same colour if seen through a post on the group page
* User marking in TikTok is impossible because they have their own stupid UI
* The time since upload is what's coloured in TikTok, and not the username
